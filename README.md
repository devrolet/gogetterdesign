# gogetterdesign
This repo is for the GoGetter Design website located at http://www.gogetterdesign.com

This website uses HTML5, CSS (LESS), and JS. Bootstrap and custom media querires are responsible for the responsiveness for the website. I will be adding more content and sections over time to enhance this website.
